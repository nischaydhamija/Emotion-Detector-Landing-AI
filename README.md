# Emotion-Detector-Landing-AI
This project is an emotion detection model developed on the Landing AI platform (LandingLens). The model is designed to classify facial expressions in real-time as "happy," "sad," or other emotions. This project demonstrates the ability to leverage no-code/low-code AI tools to build and train a functional computer vision model.

Trained on a custom dataset.

Achieved high accuracy (e.g., 97% for "happy" and 99% for "sad").

Demonstrates a practical application of machine learning for image classification.

**Platform:** Landing AI (LandingLens)

**Process:** The model was created by uploading and labeling a dataset of facial images directly on the Landing AI platform. The platform's automated tools were used to train, evaluate, and fine-tune the model's performance.
